    - Repair turrets will now consume repair packs to do the repair. If they do not have any in their own repair slot, they will search the logistic network for one. This should work with all repair packs types.
    - Repair packs being consumed from afar will drain some energy from all the cells they path through along the way.
    - Increased the charging energy of the turrets.
    - Increased the energy usage of the repair beam.
