Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2019-10-16
  Changes:
    - The turrets now heal with discrete quantum healing energy blobs instead of with beams directly. (This helps performance, but mostly I think it looks cooler).
    - Added caching to the pathfinding, to increase performance.
    - Optimized the path highlighting and beam creation.

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2019-09-24
  Changes:
    - Repair turrets will now consume repair packs to do the repair. If they do not have any in their own repair slot, they will search the logistic network for one. This should work with all repair packs types.
    - Repair packs being consumed from afar will drain some energy from all the cells they path through along the way.
    - Increased the charging energy of the turrets.
    - Increased the energy usage of the repair beam.
    - Removed repair pack from the recipe, as now they consume the repair packs to repair. Replaced it with electronic circuit.
