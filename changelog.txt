Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2019-01-24

Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2019-12-15
  Changes:
    - Made a tweak that should help turrets heal more effectively when the target is under constant attack.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2019-12-14
  Changes:
    - Added a 'Hide paths' mod setting, which will not highlight the path the repair pack takes, and will increase UPS.
    - Removed the 'energy per hop' mechanic. It was pretty insignificant and hurt UPS.
    - Made the healing blobs movement speed more consistent.
    - Some other minor performance improvements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2019-10-16
  Changes:
    - The turrets now heal with discrete quantum healing energy blobs instead of with beams directly. (This helps performance, but mostly I think it looks cooler).
    - Added caching to the pathfinding, to increase performance.
    - Optimized the path highlighting and beam creation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2019-09-24
  Changes:
    - Repair turrets will now consume repair packs to do the repair. If they do not have any in their own repair slot, they will search the logistic network for one. This should work with all repair packs types.
    - Repair packs being consumed from afar will drain some energy from all the cells they path through along the way.
    - Increased the charging energy of the turrets.
    - Increased the energy usage of the repair beam.
    - Removed repair pack from the recipe, as now they consume the repair packs to repair. Replaced it with electronic circuit.
